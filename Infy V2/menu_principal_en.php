              <p>
                  To answer our client's demand, Infinite Measures, concerning psychotechnical tests, our corporation InFy Corp has decides to conceive and furnish electronic boxes capable to test Formula 1 drivers' reflexes. </br>
          Indeed, we've noticed that nowadays, drivers were being tested solely with a ball, which they had  to catch while it was falling, as fast as possible. </br>
          Thus, InFy Corp has decided to take care of this problem by creating tests, capable of judging Formula 1 drivers' reactivity, to later determine if they are fit to drive. </br>
          The user will first have to visit an evaluation center to register and begin a new test. He will then receive a box and take a seat in fornt of one of the computers, where he will pecify his box number, so he will be able to follow in real time his tests' progress. </br>

          <h3> Take a test </h3>

Finally, all there will be left is to sit down in front of a computer, enter your box number, and follow the directions given on our website to take a test.
